# DifferentialSwerveDrive
Differential Drivetrains can both turn and translate at the same time by using a series of bevel gears and circular gear tracks; but how can it achieve this omni-directional movement?

This Differential Swerve simulation uses the gear ratios in the open source [Gluten Free swerve drive](https://www.cadcrowd.com/3d-models/differential-swerve-drive) to simulate the movement of the actual swerve drive.

Note: Stealth wheel movement in rotations, assembly unit movement in degrees.
