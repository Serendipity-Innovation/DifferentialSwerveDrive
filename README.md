# Differential Swerve Drive Simulator
This simulation uses the gear ratios in the open source [Gluten Free Differential Swerve Drive](https://www.cadcrowd.com/3d-models/differential-swerve-drive) to simulate the movement of the actual chassis intended for [Autonomous Contaminant Detecting Robot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WF40Z-JI8Ws0jd8frnWHGD_UQ12maZvN/view?usp=sharing), a robot to help identify contaminants in commercial and medical setting during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Differential Drivetrains can both turn and translate at the same time by using a series of bevel gears and circular gear tracks; but how can it achieve this? This simulation helps to better understand the individual gear track movements that make up the complex omni-directional movement.

Note: Stealth wheel movement in rotations, assembly unit movement in degrees.
